# Hey, I'm Amir (or just J) 👋

🎓 Computer Engineering student | 🤖 AI Enthusiast | 🎮 Code-slinger in training  
Welcome to the lab where all my side quests live — from algorithm puzzles to tiny apps and AI experiments.

## 🧠 What I Do (and Love)

I'm building a strong foundation in software development with a focus on:

- 🔬 **Artificial Intelligence** (long-term goal: research & impact)
- 📱 **Game & App Development** (because who doesn't love cool, interactive stuff?)
- 💡 **Problem Solving** (Data Structures, Algorithms, logic battles — the good stuff)

Currently learning by doing — one mini project, bug, and facepalm at a time.

## 🛠 Tech & Tools

- 💻 Languages: **Python**, **C++**, a bit of Visual sudio   
- ⚙️ Tools: **Git**, **VS Code**, 
- 📚 Concepts: **DSA**, **OOP**, **Basic ML**, and how not to throw the laptop when things break

## 🚧 This Repo Collection Is...

...a digital playground of:

- Practice projects  
- Class assignments  
- Self-taught experiments  
- That one time I made something work and didn’t break the system

Nothing enterprise-level here — yet. But give it a minute.

## 💼 What I'm Looking For

- ✅ **Paid internship opportunities** where I can learn, build, and contribute  
- 🧠 A team that loves tech, good vibes, and solving real problems  
- 📍Remote or hybrid preferred, but open to options

---

## 🎯 Long-Term Goals

- Do something meaningful in **AI science or engineering**  
- Contribute to research or projects that actually matter  
- Maybe build something that makes people go “Whoa. That was smart.”
